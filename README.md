# BioVRPi
BioVRPi is a newborn project, started in January 2021, that focuses on Raspberry Pi (RPi) employment in bioinformatics, with particular regards on genomics. In the previous years, some research groups have already reported several examples of applications for RPi, including bioinformatic basic training and proteomics.
Our project aims to develop and offer a low-cost, stable, and tested bioinformatic environment for students and researchers involved in genomics and transcriptomics fields.
